(it is not).\n<br />ASM will reward you with the top tier version every time - hassle free.\n<br />Examples: Savos Arens Circlet (aka 'mages circlet'). Or the Nightingale Gear - you get the best.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff]&lt;Ammunition&gt;[/color]  [/b]Sorts Arrows and Bolts - by Damage AND type.

Former Quest and skill Books optional now integrated into main file. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][b]&lt;Crafting&gt;[/b] All the games craft items have been completely re-organized for ease of use and accounting.\n<br /> Highly structured and organized, and all grouped together.\n<br />[/color]\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff]&lt;Foods-Alcohol&gt;[/color] [/b]Foods and Alcohol are sorted by type and variants&gt; (Mammoth - Raw, Salmon - Cooked etc) \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff]Dwemer&gt;[/color][/b] Cleans up Bethesda's inconsistent use of the term 'Dwarven', and renames all their artifacts &gt;  'Dwemer'.\n<br /> There is no evidence in game, or lore that TES 'Dwemer' remotely resembled anything like what we commonly think of as a 'dwarf' culturally, or physically.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff]&lt;Ingredients&gt; [/color][/b](Mountain Flower -Xxx, Egg - Chicken, Fish - Xxxx\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff]&lt;Keys&gt; [/color][/b]Sorting for [i]most[/i] keys.

Many 'misc' items now group together in discreet sub-groups.\n<br />Items such as Soul Gems, Stones of Barenziah, Crafting, 'Unique' items, clutter and more.\n<br />Misc was one of the most jumbled and disordered categories in the game by far. With ASM, managing your MISC items will be a breeze.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff] [/color][b][color=#00ffff]&lt;Perks&gt; [/color][/b] Fixes the games referring to ranged attacks, as if they were exclusively bows. \n<br />This is incorrect. Bows are not the only form of ranged weapon in the game.\n<br /> Cleans up some other badly worded perk descriptions and replaces them with improved text.\n<br /> ASM replaces the term 'bow'  and 'Archery 'with,[i] Ranged and Marksman.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff]&lt;Potions&gt; [/color][/b] Sorted by Class and type (Fortify Illusion II, Restore Health V etc). \n<br />Player-made potions always sort to the top of your inventory ie *Fortify Xxxxx \n<br />Poison potions sort separately &gt; 'Poison xxxx\n<br />Special, unique potions feature specific formatting to improve access and visibility.\n<br />Also: ASM features new pricing and weight. Bottles now scale by weight and no longer all weigh .5 (vanilla.)\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff]&lt;Quest Items&gt; [Q][/color] [/b]Many of the games No-drop quest items are tagged and sent to the top of your Category lists.\n<br />Quest items will be highly visible in your Inventory.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff] &lt;Soul Gems&gt;[/color] [/b]Numerically sorted and by state: Filled&#92;Empty. ie {Soul Gem} I (petty) {Soul Gem} V (Grand) etc. \n<br />[b][color=#00ffff]\n<br />&lt;Shouts&gt;[/color] [/b]Shouts are tagged similar to spells for the[i] Favorites[/i] menu. +Some minor text improvements.[b]\n<br />\n<br />[/b][color=#00ffff] [b]&lt;Spells-Spell Tomes-Scrolls&gt;  [/b][/color]Organized by Schools of Magic. \n<br />Bonus: The two light spells are more useful and longer lasting.\n<br />Spells, scrolls, vendor tomes, recipes and staff all share a common format.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff]&lt;Weapons&gt;[/color][/b] ASM weapons sorting. Dwemer - fully sorted. Partial sorting in effect for standard weapons.\n<br />Axes-Bows-Crossbows-Staffs are ASM sorted, including 'named', which have their own formatting.\n<br /> All Turn-Undead type weapons, now sort properly.[color=#00ffff]\n<br />[/color][/center][center][color=#00ffff][/color][b][color=#00ffff]&lt;Categorization&gt;[/color] -[/b] ASM also attempts to re-categorize some items ie, some notes are no longer categorized as books, skulls categorized as clutter etc.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Realistic weights. Most weights are based on,  Vanilla, USSEP, and WCAAF and ASMs own edits in some instances. Does not replace WCAAF, but is compatible with it. Pelts are heavy, ore and ingots are heavy, scrolls are light(0.1) etc. Weights are realistic, and immersive.[/b]\n<br />[b]Other: Some of the games more useful items among the various categories, \n<br />will appear at the top of your lists,to facilitate ease of use, access and visibility.[/b]\n<br />Examples: Azura's Star , Skeleton Key.\n<br />\n<br />Other fixes+support. \n<br />Includes built in support for many of WCAAFs feature set. [/center]\n<br />[center][color=#ff00ff][size=3]Miscellaneous Files[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />ASM Economy Rebalanced\n<br />\n<br />An optional little plug in I made designed to reign in a number of problems with Skyrims broken economy. It basically re scales the leveled(money) rewards for quests.  IoW, the rewards you receive for the various tasks are more realistic. No more getting 1000 septims for running a potion across town! \n<br />It also, BOOSTS the rewards for the underpaying 4 Bounty quests, which are frankly, far too low. 100 gold for risking your life to kill dangerous bandits? \n<br />Bartering perks and speech bonus items have been re-scaled. \n<br />\n<br />A very simple, lightweight, and no-frills way to help fix the broken economy. Give it a try\n<br />\n<br />Improved Candlelight Mesh. \n<br />\n<br />Improved the Candlelight Meshes position so it does not float in your eyes.

(and Compatibility)[/color] [/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]ASM edits nearly 7k records, the majority of the games items in fact, thus, conflicts are always a possibility with a mod this large. \n<br />ASM can \"conflict\" with mods that deal with potions, crafting materials, spells, clutter(misc), books, armors and so on.\n<br />Nothing can be done about this, except experiment with your load order, or use a compatibility file, if available.\n<br />There is no specific rule as to where ASM should go in your load order. \n<br />However, as a general guideline, it should be in the bottom quartile (25%) of your load order. \n<br />You are free to place ASM wherever you like and fine tune as you see fit.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=3]For best results, learn to sort your load order by hand rather than LOOT.  \n<br />There is no substitute for understanding how load and mod ordering actually works in Bethesda games.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b][size=3]Partial List of specific&#92;general mods types that are made redundant, obsolete, or conflict with ASM-SSE,[/size]\n<br />[size=3]where no patch file is provided (not 100% exhaustive) \n<br />[/size]\n<br />[/b][size=2]Texture Replacer mods (no esp) - [color=#00ff00]no conflict.[/color]\n<br />Mods that change stats, effects etc, of vanilla items, such as, Dragon Masks, staffs, claws, bows, etc, - [color=#ffff00]conflict.[/color]\n<br />[b]Better Skill and Quest Books Names -[/b][color=#ff0000] (redundant-conflicts)[/color]\n<br />Anything with 'ASM' in it, ASM knockoffs, etc.(redundant-conflicts-obsolete)\n<br />Any other 'sorting' mod(conflict-redundant-likely obsolete)\n<br />Spell overhauls that use vanilla forms [color=#ff0000](conflicts)[/color]- custom forms&#92;ID's [color=#00ff00](no conflict) [/color]\n<br />Book&#92;Scroll overhauls ([color=#ff0000]conflict[/color]) Note: ASM supports Book Covers Skyrim via an up-to-date, replacement ESP for that mod. \n<br />Alchemy&#92;cooking overhauls [color=#ff0000](conflicts[/color])  See optionals.  ASM supports several popular and well-made Alchemy&#92;cooking overhaul mods.\n<br />Archery Gameplay Overhaul - Fully compatible. ([color=#00ff00]no conflict.)\n<br />Vanilla Magic overhauls - Place below ASM or install compatibility file if available.\n<br />[/color]\n<br />[b]Rustic Clothing[/b] - The Child's Grey Tunic is actually [b][color=#616161] [/color][/b][b][color=#9900ff]Purple.[/color][color=#616161] [/color][/b][/size]Gamwich changed the color, but ASM will list it as a 'Grey' Tunic.[size=2][b]\n<br />Rustic Soul Gems[/b] - Use the SORTED versions. They are designed specifically for use with sorting mods like ASM.\n<br />[b]Smithing Perks Overhaul[/b] - IF using &gt; Weapons and Armor Clothing &amp; Clutter Fixes mod, place SPO below ASM AND the ASM-WaACCF patch\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b]General Rule: \n<br />If modx, modifies a [i]vanilla[/i] record, install it below ASM if you are not sure.\n<br />If modx creates its own custom formIDs, then there will no conflict.[/b]\n<br />[size=3][b]In cases of:[/b][/size]\n<br />[i][b]Conflicts[/b] - Adjust your load order accordingly to have desired mod 'win' the conflict. Or install patch file ,if available [/i]\n<br />[i][b]Redundant or obsolete[/b] - indicates mod is not needed(remove), its features already present in ASM-SSE\n<br />[/i]It is generally more important to have certain mods features take priority over ASM , ie the case of overhauls, than to see things organized as tightly as ASM does.  \n<br />Compatibility files can always be created for any mod in any event. \n<br />\n<br />[size=3][i][color=#00ffff]ASM-20x SSE uses no scripts, consumes no resources beyond a standard esp, and cannot 'damage' your save game in any way.[/color][/i]\n<br />________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n<br />[/size][b]\n<br />[size=3]Merging ASM Compatibility files. \n<br />\n<br />[/size][/b]A number of the compatibility files have been converted to ESL format.\n<br />\n<br />If you happen to run many of the supported mods, the separate files offered here can build up pretty fast in your load order.\n<br /> Building a combined ASM-SSE compatibility file, or as I would call it, a [i]UNIVERSAL ASM[/i] file is recommended.\n<br /> The resulting merged esp, will need to go fairly low in your load order of course. The best tool for this is Mators [url=https://z-edit.github.io/#/docs?t=Application_Modes]Zedit[/url]\n<br />The only thing you need to consider is, are the various ASM files you are merging modifying the same items? This could be the case.\n<br />-Avoid merging ESPs that modify the same items.\n<br />-Do not merge ESL files.\n<br />-Do not merge REPLACEMENT ESPs. \n<br />\n<br />There are other ways to create full ASM-compatibility while reducing the need for separate ESPs. Such as:\n<br />\n<br />&gt;Create custom merged ESP with SSEedit by hand. (bit tedious to do it this way if you have lots of files to work on).\n<br />\n<br />&gt;Create a Mator Smash Patch\n<br />\n<br />&gt;You can modify the mod ASM-SSE changes directly, using SSEedit to change its items to the ASM format. \n<br />When done, you can simply delete the ASM compatibility file altogether, as the mod itself has now been 'ASMified'. \n<br />Not recommended for larger mods like LoTD or Book Covers Skyrim for example, but quite doable for some of the smaller supported mods. \n<br />[i][i]\n<br />________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________[/i][/i][color=#00ff00]\n<br />[/color][center]\n<br />\n<br />[i][i][size=5][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/2782784?tab=user+files]My Mods[/url][/size][/i][/i][/center]",
